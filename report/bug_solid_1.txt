Description
The variable ‘palette’ is freed in almost every situation.

Affected Lines
From solid.c:44 to solid.c:46

Expected vs Observed
As the comment says, we want to free palette if the user provides negative height or height is 0 
and the end_ptr hasn’t moved. But in this case, in every normal case, palette is freed and there 
occurs segmentation error.

Steps to Reproduce
Command
./solid out.png 1 1 eb4034

Suggested Fix Description
If you want to free the pointer, put it in if-loop on top of free(palette).
