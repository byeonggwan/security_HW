Name
Out-of-bounds access

Description
it could access out of the image.

Affected Lines
From resize.c:62 to resize.c:63

Expected vs Observed
If a user wants to reduce a size of a image, the factor become a decimal number. Then in this case, 
if we round 'factor * img->size_x(or y)', it can be larger than the size of actual resized image,
so it occurs out-of-bounds access. (In my environment, the error says that there occurs 
double free or corruption error)

Steps to Reproduce
Command
./solid out.png 100 100 000000
./resize out.png out2.png 0.255

Suggested Fix Description
Using floor function in place of round function.
