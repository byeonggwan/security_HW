Name
allocate too large space
(double-free bug or segmentation fault)

Description
A user could try to allocate out of the maximum size of malloc.

Affected Lines
resize.c:49

Expected vs Observed
We try to allocate a memory for new image, but users are required to enter a size of the space
so they can try to allocate too large size. In my environment, it produces lots of errors like segmentation fault,
or munmap_chunk(): invalid pointer error because of the limitation of data type.

Steps to Reproduce
Command
./solid out.png 100 100 000000
./resize out.png out2.png 500

Suggested Fix Description
I couldn't find a proper answer for this, so I just limit the size.
