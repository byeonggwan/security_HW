Name
Out-of-Bounds access

Description
It accesses to out of image_data array.

Affected Lines
From checkboard.c:106 to checkboard.c:113

Expected vs Observed
We want to fill checks to the pallete, but if an height or a width of pallete is smaller than a width of a check,
there occurs Out-of-Bounds access. (malloc(): corrupted top size error).

Steps to Reproduce
Command
./checkerboard out.png 100 100 200 eb4034 ffffff

Suggested Fix Description
Compare pallete and a width of checks. If check is larger than pallete, go to error_size.
